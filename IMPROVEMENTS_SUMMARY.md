## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Enhanced Security** - Removed exposure of sensitive credentials
2. **Better Maintainability** - Reduced code duplication and improved organization
3. **Improved Reliability** - Better error handling for edge cases
4. **Performance** - Removed unnecessary debug code from production components
5. **Consistency** - Unified component structures and error handling patterns
6. **Developer Experience** - Cleaner, more organized code structure
7. **Type Safety** - Fixed many "any" type issues for better type safety
8. **Code Quality** - Eliminated unused variables and imports for cleaner code

## Additional Recommendations

Based on the ESLint output, here are additional improvements that could be made:

1. **Type Safety** - Fix all remaining "Unexpected any" errors by specifying proper TypeScript types (17 remaining)
2. **Code Quality** - Address unused variable/import warnings for better code quality
3. **Accessibility** - Fix accessibility issues like missing alt props on img elements

These changes would further improve the codebase's maintainability, type safety, and overall quality.
