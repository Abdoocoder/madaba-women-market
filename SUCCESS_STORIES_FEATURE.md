# Success Stories Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the "Success Stories" feature for the Madaba Women Market platform. The feature allows administrators to manage customer success stories and displays them to visitors on a dedicated public page.

## Feature Components

### 1. Admin Dashboard Management
Location: `/app/admin/dashboard/stories/`

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete success stories
- **Image Upload**: Integration with Cloudinary for image management
- **Internationalization**: Full support for Arabic and English languages
- **Authentication**: Admin-only access with proper role validation

#### Key Files:
- `page.tsx`: Simple wrapper component
- `success-stories-management-client.tsx`: Main client component with all functionality

### 2. API Routes
Location: `/app/api/`

#### Admin Routes (`/app/api/admin/stories/route.ts`)
- **GET**: Fetch all success stories for admin management
- **POST**: Create new success story
- **PUT**: Update existing success story
- **DELETE**: Remove success story

#### Public Routes (`/app/api/public/stories/route.ts`)
- **GET**: Fetch all success stories for public display

### 3. Public Display
Location: `/app/stories/page.tsx`

- Responsive grid layout for story cards

### 4. Internationalization
Translations available in both Arabic and English:

- **Footer Links**: `/locales/{ar|en}/footer.json`

### 5. Navigation Integration
- Added to admin dashboard navigation

\`\`\`typescript
interface SuccessStory {
  id: string;
